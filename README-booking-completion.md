# Booking Completion and Payment Follow-Up Feature

This feature automatically marks bookings as completed after their tour end date and follows up on partially paid completed bookings.

## Overview

The system automatically checks all bookings daily. If the end of tour date has passed, the booking status is updated to "Completed." Additionally, if a completed booking is marked as partially paid, the system notifies the admin to verify if the remaining payment was collected in cash during the trip.

## Implemented Features

1. **Automatic Tour Completion**:
   - When the end of tour date has passed, the system marks the booking as "Completed"
   - This happens automatically without requiring manual admin intervention

2. **Partial Payment Follow-Up**:
   - If a completed booking is marked as "Partially Paid", the system notifies the admin
   - The notification asks the admin to confirm if full payment was collected in cash on the trip day

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

- `app/controllers/admin/BookingCompletionController.php` - Controller for handling booking completion logic
- `app/cron/check_booking_completions.php` - Script to be run as a CRON job
- `routes/web.php` - Added route for manually checking booking completions
- `public/js/client/booking.js` - Added client-side trigger to check completions when page loads

### Database Updates

Uses the existing `bookings` table fields:
- `status` - Updated to 'Completed' when the tour end date has passed
- `end_of_tour` - Used to determine if the tour has ended
- `payment_status` - Checked to identify 'Partially Paid' bookings
- `completed_at` - Set to current timestamp when tour is marked as completed

## Setup Instructions

1. **Set Up CRON Job**:
   Add the following line to your server's crontab to run the check daily at midnight:
   ```
   0 0 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/app/cron/check_booking_completions.php
   ```

2. **Manual Testing**:
   You can manually trigger the booking completion check by visiting:
   ```

   ```
